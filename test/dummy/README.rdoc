= WCC Web Styles
This is a dummy application to demonstrate how the wcc_style engine can be used within a Rails application.

== Ruby version
1.9.3 or greater

== Database
  sqlite

== Installation
  bundle install
  rake db:setup

== Configuration

=== Select required wcc style
  For wcc default styles, add one of the below lines to your app/stylesheets/application.css
  *= require wcc_style/residents   <-- (green)
  *= require wcc_style/business    <-- (blue)
  *= require wcc_style/staff       <-- (blue/grey)
  *= require wcc_style/corporate   <-- (grey)
  
  If you require a custom theme, create your own custom_style.css.scss file in host application.  See below for example:  

  /****************** Site colour defaults ******************/
  $banner-bg-color: green; 
  $subnav-bg-color: darkgreen;
  $link-color: #285e8e;
  $primary-btn-color: darkgreen;
  $primary-btn-focus: green;
  $body-bg-color: #e6e6e6;
  $footer-bg-color: #e6e6e6;
  $main-bg-color: #eee;
  @import "wcc_style/framework_and_overrides.css.scss";
    
=== Customise header, footer, navigation and messages
  Customisations can be made within the app/test/dummy/app/views/wcc_style folder

== Known Issues

The resource search does not work in the dummy application.  It should search on results and match against the "title".  The results do not show when there is a match even though the underlying model search code does find the records.  The URL appends an additional "resources" in the url on then second submission, producing a URL:  http://localhost:3000/resources/resources/search
